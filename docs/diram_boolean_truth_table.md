## 🔧 CORRECTED Logic Gate Diagram - OR Gate

```
Input A ──┐
          ├─── OR Gate ─── Final Output (Memory Persist)
Input B ──┘
```

**Memory Logic**: A OR B = If ANY input is 1, memory retains it as 1

## ⚙️ OR Gate Truth Table - Memory Persistence

### Case 1: A=0, B=0
```
Input A = 0 (no memory signal)
Input B = 0 (no governance signal)
A OR B = 0 OR 0 = 0
Final Output = 0 ❌ (No memory retention)
```

### Case 2: A=0, B=1  
```
Input A = 0 (no memory signal)
Input B = 1 (governance active)
A OR B = 0 OR 1 = 1
Final Output = 1 ✅ (Memory persists due to B)
```

### Case 3: A=1, B=0
```
Input A = 1 (memory signal active)
Input B = 0 (no governance)
A OR B = 1 OR 0 = 1
Final Output = 1 ✅ (Memory persists due to A)
```

### Case 4: A=1, B=1
```
Input A = 1 (memory signal active)
Input B = 1 (governance active)
A OR B = 1 OR 1 = 1
Final Output = 1 ✅ (Memory persists - both signals)
```

## 📊 MEMORY PERSISTENCE Truth Table

| Input A | Input B | A OR B | Final Output | Memory State |
|---------|---------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| 0       | 0       | 0      | **0**        | No Retention |
| 0       | 1       | 1      | **1**        | Persist      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      | **1**        | Persist      |
| 1       | 1       | 1      | **1**        | Persist      |

**Output Pattern**: 0, 1, 1, 1 ✅

## 🧠 DIRAM Memory Retention Logic

**Memory Rule**: **ANY 1 = PERSIST IN RAM**

**Input Definitions:**
- **Input A**: Memory Data Signal (0 = No Data, 1 = Data Present)
- **Input B**: System State Signal (0 = Idle, 1 = Active)
- **Final Output**: RAM Retention (0 = Evict, 1 = Keep in Memory)

### Memory Behavior:

**Case 1: A=0, B=0** → No Data + System Idle
- **Output = 0** → **EVICT** from RAM (nothing to keep)

**Case 2: A=0, B=1** → No Data + System Active  
- **Output = 1** → **PERSIST** (system activity keeps memory warm)

**Case 3: A=1, B=0** → Data Present + System Idle
- **Output = 1** → **PERSIST** (data exists, keep in RAM)

**Case 4: A=1, B=1** → Data Present + System Active
- **Output = 1** → **PERSIST** (both signals confirm retention)

## 🔍 Memory Flow Analysis

```
Memory Flow: IF (A=1 OR B=1) THEN RAM_PERSIST = TRUE
```

**Key Insight**: Memory persists if **ANY condition is true**:
- Data exists (A=1) 
- System is active (B=1)
- Both conditions (A=1, B=1)

**Only evicts when**: Both A=0 AND B=0 (completely idle state)

---

## 🏗️ Hardware Implementation

```c
#include "diram"

uint8_t diram_memory_persist(uint8_t data_signal, uint8_t system_state) {
    // OR gate: persist if ANY signal is active
    return data_signal || system_state;
}

// Memory retention logic
void diram_update_memory(uint8_t* ram_cell, uint8_t persist_signal) {
    if (persist_signal == 1) {
        // Keep data in RAM - no eviction
        *ram_cell = *ram_cell;  // Maintain current state
    } else {
        // Evict from RAM
        *ram_cell = 0;  // Clear memory
    }
}
```

## 🎯 DIRAM Memory Philosophy

**"If a flow of 1 exists, it persists in RAM until literally evicted"**

The OR gate ensures that **ANY active signal (1)** keeps memory alive. Only when **ALL signals are 0** does the system allow eviction.

This creates **persistent memory behavior** where data stays in RAM as long as there's any reason to keep it (data presence OR system activity).
